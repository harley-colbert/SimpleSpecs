# Agent â€” Phase 0: Architecture & Contracts (UNO-less + MinerU toggle)
**Date:** 2025-10-02

> **Dependency whitelist (MUST FOLLOW)**
>
> - Python dependencies are allowed **only** if listed in `requirements.txt` (core) or `requirements-optional.txt` (extras).
> - You may not add/import any library that is not listed in one of those files.
> - If a new dependency is needed, STOP and update the requirements files first (subject to review), then proceed.
> - This whitelist is the barrier for adding libraries. No exceptions without explicit approval.
