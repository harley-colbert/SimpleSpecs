# Phase P5 — QA, Export & Packaging
**Outcome:** Polished UX; stable exports; CI with engine parity tests.

## Tasks
1. Exports: CSV/JSON with schema guarantees.
2. Parity test suite: native vs mineru fixtures (counts, coverage deltas within tolerance).
3. System capability checks surfaced in UI (optional).
4. CI: unit tests, coverage report; style/lint optional.

## Acceptance
- Full demo works under native, mineru, and auto.
- Coverage ≥80% on core modules (parsers, mapper, chunker, LLM post-processing).
